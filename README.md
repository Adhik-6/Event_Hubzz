<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

Event Hubzz is a full-featured event management and analytics platform designed to simplify the way events are organized, managed, and attended. It provides organizers with powerful tools to create events, build custom registration forms (or integrate external ones like Google Forms), and track participation with real-time analytics.

Participants can seamlessly register for events and receive QR codes for verification, while organizers can quickly validate entries using the dedicated Flutter-based scanner app. With features like Excel export, profile management, and a secure backend, Event Hubzz ensures both flexibility and reliability.

Whether you're hosting small workshops or large conferences, Event Hubzz streamlines the entire process‚Äîfrom registration to verification‚Äîmaking event management effortless and efficient.
